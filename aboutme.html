              <p>So, you've found my website. Congratulations.</p> 
              <p>Hi, I'm Anna! I'm 17 years old and I'm from Florida. And right now, I'm learning how to code. Hence, the existence of this website. So, Hello World!</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left">what do i like? :)</h2>
              <p>Dancing. I really, really like dancing.<img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cb/7b/f6/cb7bf6c7dc0097b835edc44a97bed758.gif" alt=dancing cat width="300" height="500" align="middle">And, I LOVE this cat (Borrowed from Gif Images Download).</p>

              <p>Rude people...and changing lanes when there is traffic...and coffee breath (which I currently have as I'm writing this. Sorry).</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left">fun fact</h2>
              <p>My brother and I have the same birthday. But we're not twins. I also have abnormally small pinkie fingers. #trumphands</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:left">Robotics: CIRCUITS! (7/10/17)</h2>
              <p>Today, we were challenged to build an LED circuit. After being introduced to some basic vocabulary and parts (like voltage, current, ground, etc.), we were left to our own devices and had to build an LED circuit.</p>
              <p>My group had a lot of trouble setting it up. We didn't fully understand the "Row of 5" rule, so we were not able to get our light to work until presentations when everybody was able to help us. We even burned out 2 lights when we were setting up the circuit on our own! But once we understood the flow of current and the "Row of 5" rule, we got the light to work. We used a jumper wire to connect the voltage to the breadboard for power, and in the same row, we added a resistor. The resistor then connected to the positive side of the LED, and then the negative side connects to another jumper wire. This jumper wire then connected to the ground.</p>
              <img src="https://vanillz.github.io/portfolio/image1.JPG" alt=circuit width="250" height="350">
              <p>I really experienced the importance of diverse perspectives today because without everyone's help during presentations, we probably wouldn't have been able to get our circuit working.</p>              
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/10/17)</h2>
              <p>As for my idea of robotics, I think I became less skeptical and more optimistic about the future of robots. The idea of robots being more prevalent in our society used to scare me, but now that I understand it will increase the accessibility and efficiency of our world, I am more willing to accept the advancement of robotics. However, the ethical/moral implications of robotics still makes me very wary because many times, a compromise cannot be found.</p>
              <p>Working in groups was really great because there were more ideas to work off of. I think everyone is able to work well together because we are all open to these different perspectives on finding solutions. Perhaps we can work on listening to each other better when someone is struggling and taking time to help that person understand what is going on.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Robotics: LED Light Show! (7/12/17)</h2>
              <p>Making the light show was really fun. We set the lights to the beat of "Bad Romance" by Lady Gaga and we had a lot of fun experimenting with it. Personally, I think I enjoyed setting up the circuits more than the actual programming of the robot.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/12/17)</h2>
              <p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard are working to advance the robotic movement in hopes of both making life more efficient for humankind, but also making technological life more inclusive of the world.</p>
              <p>We worked really well together on the lightshow because we always worked as a team to fix any bugs within the code. Perhaps to improve, we could more equally divide the time in front of the code.</p>
              <p>Basic pieces of every Arduino sketch include defining variables with "int", defining pins with "pinMode", using {arrays}, and using loops if needed (voidloop).</p>
