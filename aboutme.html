        <h2 style="text-align:left">Robotics: CIRCUITS! (7/10/17)</h2>
              <p>Today, we were challenge to build an LED circuit. After being introduced to some basic vocabulary and parts (like voltage, current, ground, etc.), we were left to our own devices and had to build an LED circuit.</p>
              <p>My group had a lot of trouble setting it up. We didn't fully understand the "Row of 5" rule, so we were not able to get our light to work until presentations when everybody was able to help us. We even burned out 2 lights when we were setting up the circuit on our own! But once we understood the flow of current and the "Row of 5" rule, we got the light to work.</p>
              <img src="https://vanillz.github.io/portfolio/image1.JPG" alt=circuit width="250" height="350">
              <p>I really experienced the importance of diverse perspectives today because without everyone's help during presentations, we probably wouldn't have been able to get our circuit working.</p>
