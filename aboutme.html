        <h2 style="text-align:left">Robotics: CIRCUITS! (7/10/17)</h2>
              <p>Today, we were challenged to build an LED circuit. After being introduced to some basic vocabulary and parts (like voltage, current, ground, etc.), we were left to our own devices and had to build an LED circuit.</p>
              <p>My group had a lot of trouble setting it up. We didn't fully understand the "Row of 5" rule, so we were not able to get our light to work until presentations when everybody was able to help us. We even burned out 2 lights when we were setting up the circuit on our own! But once we understood the flow of current and the "Row of 5" rule, we got the light to work. We used a jumper wire to connect the voltage to the breadboard for power, and in the same row, we added a resistor. The resistor then connected to the positive side of the LED, and then the negative side connects to another jumper wire. This jumper wire then connected to the ground.</p>
              <img src="https://vanillz.github.io/portfolio/image1.JPG" alt=circuit width="250" height="350">
              <p>I really experienced the importance of diverse perspectives today because without everyone's help during presentations, we probably wouldn't have been able to get our circuit working.</p>              
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/10/17)</h2>
              <p>As for my idea of robotics, I think I became less skeptical and more optimistic about the future of robots. The idea of robots being more prevalent in our society used to scare me, but now that I understand it will increase the accessibility and efficiency of our world, I am more willing to accept the advancement of robotics. However, the ethical/moral implications of robotics still makes me very wary because many times, a compromise cannot be found.</p>
              <p>Working in groups was really great because there were more ideas to work off of. I think everyone is able to work well together because we are all open to these different perspectives on finding solutions. Perhaps we can work on listening to each other better when someone is struggling and taking time to help that person understand what is going on.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Robotics: LED Light Show! (7/12/17)</h2>
              <p>Making the light show was really fun. We set the lights to the beat of "Bad Romance" by Lady Gaga and we had a lot of fun experimenting with it. Personally, I think I enjoyed setting up the circuits more than the actual programming of the robot.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/12/17)</h2>
              <p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard are working to advance the robotic movement in hopes of both making life more efficient for humankind, but also making technological life more inclusive of the world.</p>
              <p>We worked really well together on the lightshow because we always worked as a team to fix any bugs within the code. Perhaps to improve, we could more equally divide the time in front of the code.</p>
              <p>Basic pieces of every Arduino sketch include defining variables with "int", defining pins with "pinMode", using {arrays}, and using loops if needed (voidloop).</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/13/17)</h2>
              <p>I learned that the best way to fix a circuit that is not wokring is to begin at the starting point of the circuit, then just walk through it and see if there are any flaws (my usual mistake is not putting the wires in the right row).</p>
              <p>My favorite part was the strange ghost code...at the beginning of the robot's routine, the robot follow some weird ghost code, but it is strangely to the music, so I'm kind of okay with it. Still don't know where it comes from though</p>
              <p>Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard definitely use a lot of outputs, including sound, touch, display, lights, sensors. Definitely way more than we use!</p>              
        <h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/14/17)</h2>
              <p>The Escape Bot project was so fun! Our process involved just going for it, really...we set up some quick code with what we thought would work and we just kept testing our bot to see where the trouble areas were. So we would test, then code, then test, then code. P.S. Never forget the power of the reset button.</p>

       <p>A list is a set of items put together, but the list is able to be manipulated in multiple ways. You can add items/elements to the list, you can remove items, and you can take certain items out of the list. The items in the list are identified by their indices.</p>
       <p>I worked well with Anvitha. She helped me with functions and it was also cool that she was experimenting a lot with user input.</p>                    
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/18/17)</h2>
       <p>How does the internet work? I don't even really know because who does? Anyway, the cloud = all of the servers. There. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the internet.</p>
       <p>I would guess that LaTeX is a markup language because it formats documents. Therefore, it's a language that controls how something looks, which is what markup languages do.</p>                    
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/24/17)</h2>
       <p>There is more information about you on the internet than you may think...This information becomes available because there is a network of places your personal data is shared with, even if you only shared that information with one organization. Also, when you sign up for sites, you are also putting some of your information on the internet.</p>
       <p>A programmer can protect the privacy of their users quite a bit by using cryptation. This conceals and secures information as code, so it is less vulnerable to black-hat hackers.</p>
       <p>Latanya Sweeney and Shafi Goldwasser both work to make people's information more secure on the internet. They continue to try and understand how they can harness technology into a more safe environment by using encryption or algorithms to protect people's privacy.</p>                   
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/26/17)</h2>
       <p>Python dictionaries are useful because you can associate any given key to a value, requiring less memorization and easy accessibility of the information needed.</p>
       <p>I think people that are able to do data science are extremely smart and probably have a great understanding of math. Personally, I find it a little boring. I thought I would be more interested, but right now, it's not really appealing to me.</p>
       <p>I think algorithms are interesting because it creates shortcuts for accessing information. And they can create cool, complex models!</p>
       <p>I think algorithms play a large role in organizing information within the technology we use everyday. Ex/A "sort by" list</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/27/17)</h2>
       <p>Using objects made this project (Social Network) easier by organizing all the different parts that make up a social network. But it was harder because I still don't really understand objects...</p>
       <p>One problem I'm proud that we solved is being able to create a username...I know that is super simple, but my group had a really hard time with this project. So we are proud.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/28/17)</h2>
       <p>I'm most proud of figuring out how to print a list of users. This project was still super hard.</p>
       <p>I'm most excited for presentations because I think it will be super rewarding to show off our work after stressing out about it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (7/31/17)</h2>
       <p>To be a more effective leader, I could make sure that everybody has had a chance to share their ideas and opinions.</p>
       <p>To improve this skill, I will conciously be open to all ideas and make an effort to include everyone.</p>
       <p>At the end of a brainstorm, I could always ask if anybody else has any final ideas.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (8/1/17)</h2>
       <p>Our team is dividing up the work by splitting up the front-end and back-end tasks. Neha and I worked on the django setup, while JuHye worked on the html of our site. We chose to split it up this way based on our strengths.</p>
       <p>I'm responsible for the 'create an event' page right now. I'm going to ensure that I complete the tasks by staying up-to-date with the KanBan board and sticking to our timeline as best as possible.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (8/2/17)</h2>
       <p>The greatest challenge I've faced during the final project is really just figuring out how everything works together and being able to understand for yourself the process a tutorial may give you.</p>
       <p>I think I should just work on being more patient with myself when things go wrong and I should tell myself that there is always a way to fix these errors.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (8/3/17)</h2>
       <p>My team and I work really well together. We always seem to be on the same page with everything, and I love working with my group.</p>
       <p>One improvement we could make is making sure to update each other more on what we are doing because sometimes we get confused.</p>
       <p>Most of the bugs in our code have included merge conflicts because we are disorganized like that.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (8/4/17)</h2>
       <p>I think I'm on track to achieve my personal goals because of my group. We work really well together and have become great friends, and they motivate me to do the best I can.</p>
       <p>To stay on track, we should work on being more focused and not getting too distracted by each other.</p>
       <p>New goal: Keep coding!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left">Reflection (8/8/17)</h2>
                           <p>No, we did not get everything done because we get feature creep real bad. Oops</p>
                           <p>I would have organized the timeline more in detail if i had more time to code.</p>
                           <p>Monetize: People pay for their event to show up first.</p>
